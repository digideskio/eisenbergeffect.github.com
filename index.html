His fascination with programming started with the Commodore Basic language, then moved to Q and QuickBasic and quickly continued on to C, C++ and C#. Currently he works primarily in the area of rich JavaScript applications. Rob publishes technical articles regularly at devlicio.us and has spoken at regional events and to companies concerning .NET technologies, Agile software practices and UI engineering.
